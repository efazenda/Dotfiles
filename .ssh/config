	# X11 connections will be automatically redirected over the secure channel and DISPLAY set.
	ForwardX11

	# Timeout in minutes for untrusted X11 forwarding connextion
	ForwardX11Timeout 25M

	# Remote X11 clients will have full access to the original X11 display
	ForwardX11Trusted yes
	
	# Do not try rhosts based authentification
	RhostsRSAAuthentication no

	# RSA Authentification based (only for SSH-1)
